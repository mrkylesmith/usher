False is good, True is bad

recomb_node_id
donor_node_id
acceptor_node_id
should check
    True if any of the other flags are true,
    or if 'Mutations close to INDEL' > 5
    or if 'Mutations clumped' > 5
Breakpoints near edge
    True if the opening point of breakpoint 1 is < 100,
    and the closing point of breakpoint 2 is > 29700
breakpoints near eatchother
    True if the closing point of breakpoint 1 and the opening point of breakpoint 2 are at most 100 away
pre_b1_skew
    Number of mutations the recombinant matches with the acceptor,
    minus the number of mutations the recombinant matches with the donor,
    in the region before breakpoint 1
btw_b1_b2_skew
    Number of mutations the recombinant matches with the donor,
    minus the number of mutations the recombinant matches with the acceptor,
    in the region between breakpoint 1 and 2
post_b2_skew
    Number of mutations the recombinant matches with the acceptor,
    minus the number of mutations the recombinant matches with the donor,
    in the region after breakpoint 2
not_enough_pre_b1_skew
    True if pre_b1_skew < 0
    of if pre_b1_skew < 1 and the region before breakpoint 1 is at least 500 bps
not_enough_btw_b1_b2_skew
    True if btw_b1_b2_skew < 0
    of if btw_b1_b2_skew < 1 and the region between breakpoint 1 and 2 is at least 500 bps
not_enough_post_b2_skew
    True if post_b2_skew < 0
    of if post_b2_skew < 1 and the region after breakpoint 2 is at least 500 bps
Mutations close to INDEL
    Number of mutations which are less than 2 bps away from a '-' or 'n' 
    in the consesnsus seq of the recombinant, the donor, or the acceptor
Mutations clumped
    Greatest number of mutations which occur in any window with a width of 20 bps
Mutation clump site
    Closing point of the window of width 20 which contained 'Mutations_clumped' number of mutations
INDEL in the wrong region
    True if a large INDEL does not appear in the recombinant, and
        it does appear in the acceptor, when in the region before breakpoint 1, or
        it does appear in the donor, when in the region between breakpoints 1 and 2, or
        it does appear in the acceptor, when in the region after breakpoint 2
    a large INDEL is defined as a stretch of 11 bps which are either '-' or 'n', centered around a mutation
Parsimony change rank
    If you order all possible recombinant events by change in parsimony, this is the rank of the event with these three nodes
